## 📖 How to Play

1. **Start the game**: The game will display an empty 3x3 grid and prompt Player 1 (X) to make a move.
2. **Choose a cell**: Players take turns entering a cell number (1-9) to mark their move.
3. **Winning Condition**: The first player to mark three consecutive cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. **Draw**: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
